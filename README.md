Data Wrangling:

We retitled 2018 and 2019 columns to Family.

Coords.csv created due to long runtime for searching for countries' coordinates.

Unrecognized countries: Hong Kong, north Cyprus, somaliland region.
^These countries had to be hard coded for GeoPy.

During the merge process, some countries were spelled with or without capitalization on some words and had to be changed over manually.
